## 📊 System Overview

- Users deposit **WCRO** and selected LP tokens into the **Genesis Pool** to earn **LUME** tokens.
- Post-Genesis, users provide liquidity pairs (**LUME/CRO**, **NOVA/CRO**) in the ongoing **NOVA Farming Pool** to earn **NOVA** tokens.
- **NOVA** can be staked in the **Boardroom** for continuous **LUME** rewards.
- Boardroom rewards (**LUME**) can be claimed immediately (55% reward, 45% burned) or fully (100%) by paying a CRO fee directed to the **Treasury**.
- The **Treasury** backs the LUME peg with tangible CRO assets, actively ensuring price stability.

---

## 🧩 Tokenomics Overview

### 💠 LUME Token (Elastic Supply):
- **Pegged to CRO**
- **Daily Rebase:** Automatically adjusts supply (up to +1% expansion / -2% contraction) if TWAP deviates from the peg range (0.96–1.08 CRO).

### 🎖️ NOVA Token (Governance Token):
**Max Supply:** 21,000 NOVA

**NOVA Allocation:**
- **50%** Liquidity Providers (11,500 NOVA), distributed over 2 years, AI-governed.
- **40%** Treasury (84,000 NOVA), linear vesting over 2 years.
- **10%** Dev & Marketing (2,100 NOVA), linear vesting over 2 years.

## 🚧 Robust Stability Mechanisms: Ensuring Peg Stability

Unlike traditional protocols reliant solely on bonds (which have proven insufficient), LumeFi employs multi-layered mechanisms managed by the FrogsClub Treasury for exceptional stability:

### 📈 Expansion Phase (LUME above peg):

- **Supply Expansion:** New LUME minted, increasing supply, easing price toward peg.
- **Treasury Action:** Excess minted LUME strategically sold for CRO, increasing Treasury reserves.

### 📉 Contraction Phase (LUME below peg):

- **Elastic Rebasing:** Automatic daily negative rebases (up to -2%) reduce supply, driving LUME price upward.
- **Collateral Redemption:** Users burn LUME to redeem CRO directly from the Treasury, reducing circulating supply.
- **Treasury Buybacks:** Treasury utilizes accumulated CRO reserves to repurchase undervalued LUME, supporting price recovery.

## 📌 LUME Expansion Allocation (When Above Peg)

| Allocation              | Percentage |
|-------------------------|------------|
| **Boardroom Rewards**   | 60%        |
| **Treasury (Collateral)**| 30%       |
| **Dev & Marketing**     | 10%        |
